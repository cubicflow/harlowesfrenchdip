        <h3>Mustard made with beer</h3>

        <div class="fact-grid__col--textcontent__body">
          <p><strong>Harlowe’s is one-upping the craft condiment game. Our house mustard is artfully made using La Fin Du Monde beer direct from Chambly, Quebec.</strong></p>

          <p>Harlowe’s La Fin Du Mustard is especially made to compliment our Slow Roasted Pork Dip and Pastrami — that said, we’ve seen our fans enjoy it with (almost) every sandwich we’ve ever made.</p>

          <p>Magicians tend to not reveal secrets. Here’s ours — we take our mustard, made from wholesome seed, cayanne, and a batch of house spices. Mixed and blended, we marinate the mustard base in La Fin Du Monde overnight which is then strained, chilled, and served fresh.</p>

          <p>The La Fin Du Monde beer itself? If you aren’t lucky enough to catch it on tap it’s also available in a bottle as part of our Craft Beer Program.</p>
