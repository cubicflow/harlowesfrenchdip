  <div class="home-description">
    Centered in historic Old Pasadena, CA, the handsome and fully-restored wood interior of Harlowe’s French Dip surrounds you and brings back the warmth of the original 1930's Art Deco building. Harlowe's is a place where modern and vibrant ingredients play melodic renditions of classic dishes — an ensemble of signature sandwiches and upscale pub fare. Think Pulled pork and Texas toast across from fresh oysters, burgers and beer cheese…with beignets for dessert. By using only the freshest product we aim to elevate treat each component with the&nbsp;utmost&nbsp;respect.
